      <h3>What is Bitcoin?</h3>
      <p style="margin-top: 20px;"> </p>
      <p>Bitcoin is a decentralized online currency known as a cryptocurrency. Bitcoin was originally developed by an individual or individuals going under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto.
         Bitcoin was developed with the idea that there should be an easier way to facilitate peer-to-peer transactions online without having to rely on a third party money manager such as PayPal.
         Nakamoto defines a singular Bitcoin as a "chain of digital signatures" [1]. Using public/private key cryptography an owner of a Bitcoin can initiate a transaction using a public key and then sign the transaction as valid, transferring ownership to the new owner via their public key. The results of these signatures and transactions are publicly available and accessible in a cryptographically secure storage medium called a block chain.
        <p>
         Bitcoin is not a fiat currency, it is not backed by any banks or governments. Any vendor can choose to deal in Bitcoin (or other cryptocurrencies) only if they choose to. 
      </p>
      <h3>What is Blockchain?</h3>
    <p>
        A block chain is a data structure built on cryptographic hashes. A basic cryptocurrency blockchain contains four discrete structures:
        <ol>
       <li>Hash</li>
        <li>Nonce</li>
       <li>List of Transactions</li>
       <li>Timestamp</li>
       </ol>
       <p>
       Each block in the chain contains the block hash of the block that came before it, somewhat like a linked list. This hash forms the "chain" of the blockchain. From any block N, it is possible to trace back through the hashed value of the blocks until reaching the very first block of the chain, the genesis block. [2]
       <p>
       Thus, if a blockchain was 10 blocks long, and someone attempted to make a change at block 4, it would cause all of the hashes past block 4 to be invalid and the change would likely be rejected. Blockchains of sufficient length are secure in that it is difficult and very unlikely to find the "correct" cryptographic hash of a block. Bitcoin, for example, requires a certain number of leading zeroes at the beginning of a prospective block's hash. Given that the output of a hash function is nearly impossible to predict, the attacker of the blockchain would have to then generate "correct" hashes for all blocks that came after block 4 all the way until block 10. This "new" altered blockchain would then have to be accepted by the Bitcoin network. [1][2]
    <p>
       The block hashes for Bitcoin are generated by combining the Nonce and the Merkle Root Hash of the list of transactions. The Merkle Root Hash is generated via a binary tree structure, with the bottom leaves being the actual plaintext of the transactions themselves, with all of the leaves above them being the hash generated by each of their edge nodes. The nonce is simply a 32-bit number that is iterated by one and combined with the Merkle Root hash into the SHA-256 hashing algorithm. The intent is the combination of these two generating a hash with the correct amount of leading zeroes to be a valid hash for the Bitcoin network.
    <p>
       The timestamp is a timestamp. Bitcoin includes other information in its blocks, but that is not particularly important for this discussion.
