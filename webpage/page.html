      <p>Bitcoin is an online currency known as a cryptocurrency. It was created in 2008 by an individual known online as Satoshi Nakamoto, who is unknown in the real world.
         It has increased in popularity in the last few years because of the increasing value that each bitcoin holds. Bitcoin is not traceable and decetralized, making it very popular
         with inviduals looking to anonymously buy illegal products and services online though the dark web. The value of a bitcoin is very volatile and has reached
         a high of around $20,000 in early 2018.

      <h3>What is Blockchain?</h3>
      <p><img style="padding: 0 15px; float: right;" src="blockchain.jpg" class="image3" alt="blockchain"></p>
      <p>A blockchain is basically a long chain of blocks holding information regarding past transcations. It's similar to a database as it holds
         the information of all past transactions and is easily traceable. This information is instantly viewable and any transaction made becomes public. This allows
         peers to exchange bitcoins without needing a middle man, such as a bank or institution.
